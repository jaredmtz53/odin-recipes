                    <ol>
                        <li> Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat
                            until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an
                            even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1
                            minute without stirring.</li>
                        <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp
                            begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for
                            1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece of butter,
                            and 1/2 of the parsley; cook until butter has
                            melted, about 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces
                            butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce
                            is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3
                            minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a
                            bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water, 1
                            teaspoon at a time, if too thick, about 2 minutes.
                            Season with salt to taste; serve shrimp topped with
                            the pan sauce and remaining parsley. </li>
